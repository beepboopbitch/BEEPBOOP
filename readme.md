#### _Number translator_

#### By _**Nayomi Morita**_

## Description

_A website that has a single input for numbers that uses functions to translate them into a series of beeps and boops depending on their value,_

## Specs

* _Web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:_
* _1 returns "Beep"_
* _2 returns "Boop"_
* _3 returns "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."_
* _User inputted 5 should have an output of: 0,"Beep","Boop","I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", 4, 5,_
* _if a number has a 3 and a 1 or 2 also (ex:31,23,13) then the number is treated under the same conditions as just a 3, returning a "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."._
* _if a number has a 2 and 1 (ex:12,21,211) then the number is treated under the same conditions as 2, returning a "Boop"._
* _A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again._
